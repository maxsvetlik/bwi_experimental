Using the programs in this folder, you can create .cdcode files from 2d images for the purpose of drawing with the Jaco Kinova robot arm manipulator.

Brief how-to:

Compile:
1)In the opencv directory, run cmake .
2)run make

Run the program
1) run `./transforms someimagefile.jpg outputname`
if successful, outputname.cdcode will have been generated and output into the `drawing_code` directory outside of the opencv dir.
